# Waybar Configuration

This is a custom configuration for [Waybar](https://github.com/Alexays/Waybar), a highly customizable bar for Wayland window managers.

## 📁 File Structure

- `config`: Main Waybar configuration file
- `style.css`: Custom styling for Waybar widgets

## 📝 Notes

- Some appearance settings attempt to load a colour scheme from [pywal](https://github.com/dylanaraps/pywal). If you're not using `pywal`, you may need to remove the import line in `style.css` or install `pywal` and run it with an image.
- Warnings about units (like `px`) may appear if you are using an outdated syntax. These have been preserved as in the original, but you may update them if needed.
